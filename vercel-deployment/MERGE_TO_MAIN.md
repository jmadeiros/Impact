# ðŸ”„ Make advanced-rag/src the New Main Branch

## Why This Makes Sense
- Your `advanced-rag/src` branch has the complete, working Vercel deployment
- All 23 tests are passing
- Pinecone database is populated with 30 survey responses
- The current `main` branch is missing all the Vercel work

## Option 1: Merge advanced-rag/src into main (Recommended)

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the advanced-rag/src branch
git merge advanced-rag/src

# Push the updated main branch
git push origin main
```

## Option 2: Replace main with advanced-rag/src (More aggressive)

```bash
# Create a backup of current main (just in case)
git checkout main
git branch main-backup

# Reset main to match advanced-rag/src exactly
git reset --hard advanced-rag/src

# Force push to update remote main
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## After Merging

Once your main branch has all the Vercel deployment code:

### Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select your GitHub repository: `jmadeiros/Impact`
4. Use `main` branch (default)
5. Set root directory to `vercel-deployment`
6. Add environment variables
7. Deploy!

### Environment Variables for Vercel
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyDEhe7LmWNe_ua2z0YqlOuMjpTbjpve1lU
PINECONE_API_KEY=pcsk_6BVaTz_K9J4jJeEF52GsBBGPNRGQ1uz6vuZ52ZHCfcKUASJ2KLr7Yt5mch3qo7QfHjH6Ls
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=gcp-starter
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=rag-survey-responses
PINECONE_NAMESPACE=production
VECTOR_STORE_TYPE=pinecone
ENVIRONMENT=production
DEBUG=false
```

## Benefits of This Approach
âœ… **Simpler deployment** - Everything on main branch  
âœ… **Cleaner repository** - One source of truth  
âœ… **Standard workflow** - Deploy from main is conventional  
âœ… **All features preserved** - Nothing lost in the merge  

## What You'll Have After Merge
- Complete Vercel RAG deployment system
- All API endpoints working
- Comprehensive test suite (23/23 passing)
- Populated Pinecone database
- Production-ready configuration
- Full documentation

ðŸŽ¯ **Recommendation**: Use Option 1 (merge) - it's safer and preserves history.
