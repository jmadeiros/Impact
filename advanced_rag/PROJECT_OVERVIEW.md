- Cites specific story: "I learned that failing once doesn't make you a failure"
- Provides demographic context: Stronger pattern in 15-17 age group
- Generates conversational explanation with evidence

**Query**: "Which organizations are most effective?"
**System Process**:
- Compares approaches: YCUK ("Leading a project") vs Symphony Studios ("Group discussion")
- Notes age-specific focus: Palace for Life works with younger participants
- Acknowledges limitations: Small sample size prevents definitive ranking
- Suggests different organizations excel in different areas
