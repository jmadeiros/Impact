## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### **First Time Setup**
```bash
# 1. Navigate to advanced RAG folder
cd advanced_rag

# 2. Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements_advanced.txt

# 3. Set up environment variables in ../.env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
SUPABASE_URL=your_url_here
SUPABASE_KEY=your_key_here

# 4. Run automated setup
python3 setup_advanced.py
```

### **Daily Usage**
```bash
# Quick start (recommended)
python3 start_web_interface.py

# Or start web server directly
python3 web_server.py
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **If Web Interface Won't Start:**
```bash
# Check system requirements
python3 -c "from conversational_rag import ConversationalRAGSystem; print('✅ System ready')"

# Rebuild vector store if needed
python3 vector_store.py

# Check API keys
cat ../.env | grep GOOGLE_API_KEY
```

### **If Getting Empty Responses:**
- Check internet connection (needs Google AI API)
- Verify API key is valid and has quota
- Try simpler questions first

### **If Responses Seem Off:**
- The system has 30 survey responses total
- Some questions may have limited relevant data
- Try broader or different phrasings

### **Common Issues:**
```bash
# ChromaDB issues
rm -rf vector_store/
python3 vector_store.py

# Dependency issues
pip3 install -r requirements_advanced.txt --upgrade

# Data sync issues
python3 data_sync.py
```

## 🔄 Alternative Interfaces

### **Command Line Testing**
```bash
# Test individual components
python3 embeddings_test.py
python3 conversational_rag.py

# Run full system test
python3 test_advanced.py

# System performance trace
python3 system_trace.py
```

### **API Access**
```python
import requests

# Chat endpoint
response = requests.post('http://localhost:8002/chat', 
    json={'message': 'Your question here'})
print(response.json()['message'])

# Health check
response = requests.get('http://localhost:8002/health')
print(response.json())
```

### **Direct Python Usage**
```python
from conversational_rag import ConversationalRAGSystem

# Initialize system
rag = ConversationalRAGSystem()

# Ask questions
result = rag.chat("How do programs build confidence?")
print(result['answer'])
print(f"Evidence: {result['evidence_count']} responses")
```

## 📊 Understanding the Data

### **What's in the System:**
- **30 Total Responses** from youth program participants
- **4 Organizations**: YCUK, I AM IN ME, Palace for Life, Symphony Studios
- **2 Age Groups**: 12-14 and 15-17 year olds
- **3 Question Types**: Stories, MCQ choices, Ratings
- **22 Searchable Documents** (after intelligent filtering)

### **How It Works:**
1. Your question gets converted to a 384-dimensional vector
2. System finds the 5 most semantically similar survey responses
3. Google Gemini AI reads all responses and synthesizes insights
4. You get a conversational answer with evidence attribution

## 🎯 Pro Tips

### **For Best Results:**
- Ask open-ended questions about impacts and outcomes
- Use natural language ("How do..." "What helps..." "Show me...")
- Try the suggested question buttons for inspiration
- Ask follow-up questions to dig deeper

### **For Different Audiences:**
- **Casual Users**: Use web interface, ask conversational questions
- **Researchers**: Try comparative questions across organizations/ages
- **Funders**: Ask about evidence and effectiveness
- **Program Staff**: Ask about specific challenges and successes

### **Sample Question Progression:**
1. Start broad: "How do programs build confidence?"
2. Get specific: "What specific activities build confidence?"
3. Compare: "How does confidence building differ by age group?"
4. Deep dive: "Show me stories about overcoming challenges"

### **Web Interface Tips:**
- Use suggested question buttons for quick exploration
- Watch the evidence count to understand data coverage
- Note which organizations contribute to each answer
- Try rephrasing questions if results seem limited

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **System Limitations:**
- **Data Size**: 30 responses is a small sample - system acknowledges this
- **API Costs**: Uses Google AI API (paid service after free tier)
- **Response Time**: 2-5 seconds for complex questions
- **Accuracy**: Semantic search finds relevant content, but AI interpretation may vary

### **Data Safety:**
- System uses a local snapshot (`data_snapshot.json`)
- No risk to production database
- Safe for experimentation and testing
