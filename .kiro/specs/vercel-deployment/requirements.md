# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Vercel-deployable version of the advanced RAG system in a completely separate folder structure. The goal is to adapt the existing advanced RAG functionality to work in Vercel's serverless environment without modifying any existing files or folders. All deployment-related code will be created in a new `vercel-deployment` directory, copying and adapting necessary components from the existing `advanced_rag` folder while preserving the original codebase entirely.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the advanced RAG system to Vercel, so that I can have a hosted version of my RAG application accessible via web APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment is created THEN the system SHALL create a new `vercel-deployment` folder without modifying any existing files or folders
2. WHEN code is needed from existing advanced RAG system THEN it SHALL be copied and adapted in the new folder, leaving originals untouched
3. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL maintain all core RAG functionality including vector search, embeddings, and conversational AI
4. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL respond with the same functionality as the local advanced RAG system
5. WHEN the deployment is complete THEN the system SHALL include proper Vercel configuration files (vercel.json, package.json) in the new folder only

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the RAG system through web APIs, so that I can query documents and get AI-powered responses from any client application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a POST request to `/api/query` THEN the system SHALL return relevant document chunks and AI-generated responses
2. WHEN I send a POST request to `/api/upload` THEN the system SHALL process and store documents in the vector database
3. WHEN I send a GET request to `/api/health` THEN the system SHALL return the deployment status and available endpoints
4. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the vector database to work in Vercel's serverless environment, so that document embeddings and similarity search function correctly in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings using the same embedding model as the local system
2. WHEN similarity searches are performed THEN the system SHALL return relevant document chunks with similarity scores
3. WHEN the vector store is accessed THEN it SHALL persist data between serverless function invocations
4. IF the vector store is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment configuration for Vercel deployment, so that API keys and database connections work securely in the hosted environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN the system SHALL use Vercel's environment variable system
2. WHEN API keys are needed THEN the system SHALL securely access them from environment variables
3. WHEN database connections are established THEN they SHALL work with Vercel's serverless function constraints
4. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about required environment variables

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle Vercel's serverless constraints, so that the RAG functionality works within platform limitations (cold starts, memory limits, timeouts, stateless functions).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN functions experience cold starts THEN the system SHALL initialize quickly without loading large models on startup
2. WHEN functions hit memory limits (1GB max) THEN the system SHALL use external storage for vector embeddings and large data
3. WHEN functions approach timeout limits (10s Hobby, 60s Pro) THEN operations SHALL complete within these constraints
4. WHEN functions need persistent data THEN the system SHALL use external services (Pinecone, Supabase, or similar) instead of local file storage
5. WHEN the system needs to maintain state THEN it SHALL use stateless architecture with external data persistence

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deployment to include proper dependency management, so that all required packages are available in the Vercel environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment is built THEN all Python dependencies SHALL be properly installed and available
2. WHEN serverless functions execute THEN they SHALL have access to all required libraries (langchain, chromadb, etc.)
3. WHEN package conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL use compatible versions that work in Vercel's environment
4. WHEN build processes run THEN they SHALL complete successfully without dependency errors
