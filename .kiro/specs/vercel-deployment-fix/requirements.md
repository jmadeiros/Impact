# Vercel RAG Deployment Fix Requirements

## Introduction

The user has a working RAG system locally but is experiencing failures when trying to use it. The system shows "Collection does not exist" errors, indicating a vector database configuration issue. Additionally, the user wants to deploy this to Vercel using their connected GitHub account. We need to fix the vector database setup and create a smooth deployment process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Vector Database Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my RAG system to connect to the correct vector database so that chat queries work properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL connect to the configured vector store without errors
2. WHEN a user sends a chat message THEN the system SHALL successfully retrieve relevant documents from the vector database
3. IF the vector database is empty THEN the system SHALL provide a helpful error message explaining how to populate it
4. WHEN switching between Pinecone and Supabase THEN the system SHALL use the correct configuration for the selected vector store
5. WHEN the vector database connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear troubleshooting information

### Requirement 2: Populate Vector Database with Survey Data

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to populate the vector database with survey response data so that the RAG system can provide meaningful answers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the data population script THEN it SHALL successfully load survey data into the configured vector store
2. WHEN data is populated THEN the system SHALL confirm the number of documents added
3. IF data population fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages about what went wrong
4. WHEN data already exists THEN the system SHALL offer options to update or skip existing data
5. WHEN population is complete THEN the chat system SHALL be able to retrieve and use the data

### Requirement 3: Deploy to Vercel via GitHub

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy my RAG system to Vercel using my connected GitHub account so that it's accessible online.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pushing code to GitHub THEN Vercel SHALL automatically detect and deploy the application
2. WHEN deploying THEN all environment variables SHALL be properly configured in Vercel
3. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the health endpoint SHALL return a successful status
4. WHEN users access the deployed chat endpoint THEN it SHALL work the same as the local version
5. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 4: Environment Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear environment configuration so that I can easily switch between development and production setups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up locally THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for required environment variables
2. WHEN deploying to Vercel THEN the system SHALL validate that all required environment variables are present
3. WHEN switching vector stores THEN the configuration SHALL be clearly documented
4. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on what to add
5. WHEN configuration is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a health check to verify everything works

### Requirement 5: Troubleshooting and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and error handling so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about the failure
2. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL perform health checks on all critical components
3. WHEN vector database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific error codes and solutions
4. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff where appropriate
5. WHEN deployed to Vercel THEN logs SHALL be accessible through the Vercel dashboard
